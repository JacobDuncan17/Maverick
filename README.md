* Replacing div tags with semantic html
* Removing classes that were not needed
* Fixing the head to be in sequential order

## CSS Cleanup:

The steps included:

* Removing styling for multiple sections that could be done at the same time
* Remove background img from css file and putting in the html file with a semantic element

After completing the cleanup the webpage is fully functional. The finished project looks like:
